**The simplest SpigotMC rules plugin there is.**

SimpleRules is a stupid simple rules plugin made for SpigotMC. 
This plugin offers an extensive and customizable styling format for a simple rules.txt file - it can be styled in any way you want it to! Thinking about making a red, bolded rule list? Go ahead! Want to have &k stylings on the rule numbers, or even have each rule be rainbow? Bam! 

The plugin is stupid simple to use. All you have to do is install it and edit the "rules.txt" file you are given. Once you save the file, run _/rules reload_ to reload the rules list!
